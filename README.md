Ideas:
* Try to check if the order of alignments in 1/2 approx matters for the score. Do this by sorting the sequences based on a min spanning tree you get from the dist matrix in the linear al.s.

Problems/notes:
* Um so the visiting order is printed in letters, I guess we need something that better corresponds to the original order in matrix
* It seems that there are some nodes that don't get connected to the others in the end in the applied tree!!!!
